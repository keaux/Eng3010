							<p>According to <a href="https://www.thespectrum.com/story/news/2022/09/02/inflation-housing-market-utah-job-growth-economy-employment/7959177001/"> Benjamin Crabb</a>,   the regional economist for central and southwestern Utah for the DWS, and other local news, the St. George area continues to grow. The region was one of the fastest to rebound from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Washington County adding more than 8,000 new jobs between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year, according to DWS figures. "Washington County has been just booming for years. Even the COVID setback was extraordinarily temporary," said Benjamin Crabb, the regional economist for central and southwestern Utah for the DWS.

This doesn't surprise me. We have seen a 5% job growth in the St. George area, as well as the population growth and the continual construction needed makes this very viable," said Ben Crabb. He serves as the regional economist for the southwest and central areas under the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Crabb maintained a positive outlook when speaking about the economic future of Utah. Crabb relayed that the number of residential homes has increased since 2010. The increase is due to several factors, Crabb said, such as population growth from retired individuals looking for a place to settle down, families looking for better educational opportunities for their children, and a stable environment with the ability to maintain available jobs and essential living needs. "It really has been a growing field for almost the last two decades," Crabb said.
